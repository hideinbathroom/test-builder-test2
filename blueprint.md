# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This project is a simple web application that generates random lotto numbers for the user. It also includes a feature to switch between light and dark modes.

## Features

1.  **Lotto Number Generation:** Generates 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
2.  **Dark/Light Mode:** Allows the user to switch between a light and dark theme. The preference is saved in the browser's local storage.

## Plan

1.  **HTML (`index.html`):** Create the basic structure of the web page, including a title, a button to trigger the number generation, a container to display the generated numbers, and a toggle switch for the theme.
2.  **CSS (`style.css`):** Style the elements to make the interface clean and user-friendly. This includes defining color variables for both light and dark themes and styling the theme toggle switch.
3.  **JavaScript (`main.js`):**
    *   Implement the logic for generating 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
    *   Implement the logic for the theme switcher, including saving the user's preference to local storage.
